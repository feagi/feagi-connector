# Connect with Cozmo
There are two ways. The easiest and simplest way is to have your computer connect to Cozmo. Once 
you lift cozmo's arm and put it back down, you should see the WiFi password displayed on the LCD. 
Connect to Cozmo using the password on the LCD. Once you're connected to Cozmo, you can simply run the code `python3 controller.py`, and it will automatically connect to FEAGI.

Another method: This method works on Windows and Linux only. It's currently not supported by Mac 
due to security reasons. Buy a WiFi dongle, then connect it to Cozmo. It will connect to the 
controller once you run it. Be sure to specify the IP address on the controller's configuration to 
connect to FEAGI (Playground, NRS, or local).
